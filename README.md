# touchindex

Like `touch index.html`, but just a little better.

There are lots of scaffolding tools out there.  
`touchindex` aims to be as simple as possible, very bare bones tool to create just enough
HTML, CSS and JavaScript to get a quick demo rolling. It consists of one file and zero
dependencies, so istallation process is fast.

To scaffold a simple project to your current directory, just run:
```sh
npx touchindex html js css
```

and then open the geneated `index.html` file in your browser, or use a
tool like [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to serve the files.
